# SemanticMEG

This repository showcases the results for the evoked-field analysis of a semantic priming task performed by two healthy subjects during MEG recordings.

Analysis are ongoing. Our team is working on the following tasks:

1. analysis and visualisation of event-related potential, plot mean and standard error
2. plot topography for congruent, incongruent conditions and their contrast
3. analyse signal stability before and after break
4. compare N400 response between participants
